# Transmog

A Minecraft mod to solve the long-standing issue of not looking cool enough.  
Transmog allows you to change the appearance of items without modifying their behavior at all!  
It works on armor, weapons, tools and anything else you can imagine!

# How Transmogrifying Works
Place the transmogrification table in the world and right-click it, the transmogrification UI will open:

From left to right, the slots are:  
1. The fuel slot. Every Amethyst Shard fills up the power of the Transmogrification Table, and each action will remove one third of it.
2. The target slot. The item you place in here is the one that will be transmogrified.
3. The appearance slot. The item you place here will be the one that decides the appearance of the target item and will **not** be consumed in the process.
## Appearance
For most items, the appearance slot will serve as the direct appearance for the target item, the only exceptions to this are:
* Transmogrified Items. The target item will gain the transmogrification of the existing item, instead of its original appearance.
* Void Fragments. If you place one of these in the Appearance Slot, the target item will be transmogrified into a hidden item.  

To remove the transmogrification from an item, place it in the transmogrification table without an appearance item.
